## 1. Overview

This page outlines the architectural principles and system-level components
of 5G and emerging 6G networks. It focuses on the radio access, core network,
and distributed intelligence layers.

## 2. Key Components

- **gNB and RAN Architecture**
- **Service-Based Core (SBA)**
- **Network Slicing**
- **MEC (Multi-access Edge Computing)**
- **Cloud-Native Functions**
- **Non-Terrestrial Networks (6G)**

---

## 3. Design Goals

- High data rates and ultra-low latency  
- Massive device connectivity (mMTC)  
- Energy efficiency and sustainability  
- Resilience and self-optimization  
- Secure and trusted communication

## 4. Comparison Snapshot

| Feature | 5G | 6G (Projected) |
|--------|----|----------------|
| Peak Data Rate | 10 Gbps | >100 Gbps |
| Latency | ~1 ms | ~0.1 ms |
| AI-native? | No | Yes |
| Non-terrestrial | Optional | Native |
| Use cases | URLLC, eMBB, mMTC | Holography, XR, Digital Twin |
