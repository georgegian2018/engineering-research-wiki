## 1. Overview

Engineering systems increasingly rely on AI components for sensing,
decision-making, and control. Ethical integration focuses on ensuring
transparency, safety, and alignment with human values.

---

## 2. Key Concerns

- Bias and fairness in data and models  
- Transparency and explainability  
- Robustness to adversarial inputs  
- Human-in-the-loop controls  
- Regulatory and legal compliance  

---

## 3. Integration Principles

1. **Predictive Safety**  
   Anticipate edge cases before deployment.

2. **Model Auditability**  
   Enable traceable reasoning and versioning.

3. **Responsibility Assignment**  
   Define accountability across software, hardware, human interfaces.
