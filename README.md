A structured, research-oriented knowledge base documenting engineering concepts,
methods, system-level designs, and technical notes aligned with academic research
and standards-driven professional practice.

This repository emphasizes **clarity, rigor, and long-term value**, bridging
the gap between theory, simulation, and real-world engineering systems.
