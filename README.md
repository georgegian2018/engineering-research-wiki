## How to Use This Wiki

This repository is organised as a research-oriented wiki.

- Each topic lives in its own Markdown file under `wiki/`
- All pages follow the same **wiki page template**
- Content is written to be:
  - technically precise
  - research-aligned
  - reusable across papers, reports, and teaching material

Pages may evolve from:
- notes → structured documentation → publishable material

This repository prioritises **clarity, traceability, and long-term value**
over quick notes or informal tutorials.
